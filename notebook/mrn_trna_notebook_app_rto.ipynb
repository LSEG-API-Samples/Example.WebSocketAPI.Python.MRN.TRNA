    "## Prerequisite\n",
    "\n",
    "This article/notebook supports all [Machine Readable News Analytics (TRNA)](https://www.lseg.com/en/data-analytics/financial-news-service/machine-readable-news) data data consumption from The Real-Time with the WebSocket API. However, the data model description is focusing on the News Analytics (TRNA) data processing only. \n",
    "\n",
    "I highly recommend you check the  [WebSocket API Tutorials](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/real-time-opnsrc/websocket-api/tutorials) page if you are not familiar with WebSocket API. The Tutorials page provides a step-by-step guide (connect, log in, request data, parse data, etc) for developers who are interested in developing a WebSocket application to consume real-time data from  Real-Time. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are focusing on the Real-Time News, please check the following GitHub repositories\n",

You can find how to migrate your Version 1 Authentication application to the Version 2 Authentication (Service ID) from the [Real-Time WebSocket API: The Real-Time Optimized Version 2 Authentication Migration Guide](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/webSocket-api-rto-v2-authentication-migration-guide) and [Migrating the WebSocket Machine Readable News Application to Version 2 Authentication](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/migrating-the-websocket-machine-readable-news-to-rto-v2) articles.\n",

    "Please contact your LSEG's representative to help you to access the RTO account, and services.

    "## News Analytics and Machine Readable News Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Machine Readable News Analytics (TRNA)](https://www.lseg.com/en/data-analytics/financial-news-service/machine-readable-news) provides real-time numerical insight into the events on multiple news sources, in a format that can be directly consumed by algorithmic trading systems. TRNA enables algorithms to exploit the power of news to seize opportunities, capitalize on market inefficiencies, and manage event risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRNA is published via the Real-Time Platform as part of Machine Readable News (MRN) data model. MRN is an advanced service for automating the consumption and systematic analysis of news. It delivers deep historical news archives, ultra-low latency structured news, and news analytics directly to your applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "### MRN Data behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "RN is published over the Real-Time platform using an Open Message Model (OMM) envelope in News Text Analytics domain messages. The Real-time News content set is made available over MRN_STORY RIC. The content data is contained in a FRAGMENT field that has been compressed and potentially fragmented across multiple messages, to reduce bandwidth and message size.\n",
    "\n",
    "A FRAGMENT field has a different data type based on a connection type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- RSSL connection (RTSDK [C++](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/real-time-opnsrc/rt-sdk-cc)/[C#](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/real-time-opnsrc/rt-sdk-csharp)/[Java](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/real-time-opnsrc/rt-sdk-java)): BUFFER type\n",
    "- WebSocket connection: Base64 ASCII string\n",
    "\n",
    "The data goes through the following series of transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The core content data is a UTF-8 JSON string\n",
    "2. This JSON string is compressed using gzip\n",
    "3. The compressed JSON is split into several fragments (BUFFER or Base64 ASCII string) which each fit into a single update message\n",
    "4. The data fragments are added to an update message as the FRAGMENT field value in a FieldList envelope\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/trna_process.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to parse the core content data, the application will need to reverse this process. The WebSocket application also needs to convert a received Base64 string in a FRAGMENT field to bytes data before further process this field. This application uses Python [base64](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html) and [zlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html) modules to decode Base64 string and decompress JSON string.

    "### MRN Data model\n",
    "\n",
    "Five fields, as well as the RIC itself, are necessary to determine whether the entire item has been received in its various fragments and how to concatenate the fragments to reconstruct the item:\n",
    "* MRN_SRC: identifier of the scoring/processing system that published the FRAGMENT\n",
    "* GUID: a globally unique identifier for the data item. All messages for this data item will have the same GUID values.\n",
    "* FRAGMENT: compressed data item fragment, itself\n",
    "* TOT_SIZE: total size in bytes of the fragmented data\n",
    "* FRAG_NUM: sequence number of fragments within a data item. This is set to 1 for the first fragment of each item published and is incremented for each subsequent fragment for the same item.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single MRN data item publication is uniquely identified by the combination of RIC, MRN_SRC, and GUID.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fragmentation\n",
    "For a given RIC-MRN_SRC-GUID combination, when a data item requires only a single message, then TOT_SIZE will equal the number of bytes in the FRAGMENT, and FRAG_NUM will be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple messages are required, then the data item can be deemed as fully received once the sum of the number of bytes of each FRAGMENT equals TOT_SUM. The consumer will also observe that all FRAG_NUM range from 1 to the number of the fragment, with no intermediate integers, skipped. In other words, a data item transmitted over three messages will contain FRAG_NUM values of 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compression\n",
    "The FRAGMENT field is compressed with gzip compression, thus requiring the consumer to decompress to reveal the JSON plain-text data in that FID.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an MRN data item is sent in multiple messages, all the messages must be received and their FRAGMENTs concatenated before being decompressed. In other words, the FRAGMENTs should not be decompressed independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decompressed output is encoded in UTF-8 and formatted as JSON."

    "\n",
    "    * By assetClass value:\n",
    "    “CMPNY”: “P:” prefix for PermID and “R:” for RIC. Can contain multiple RICs for a single company, including the primary one and those tagged to the news item.\n",

    "\n",
    "The novelty of the content within a news item on a particular asset is calculated by comparing it with the asset-specific text over a cache of previous news items that contain the asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between items is done using a linguistic fingerprint. If the news items are similar, they are termed as being “linked”. As a result, a content item can “link” only to an item of the same language.\n",

    "There are five historical periods that are used in the comparison. The default periods are 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days prior to the news item’s timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Volume Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "The volume of news for each asset is calculated. A cache of previous news items is maintained and the number of news items that mention the asset within each of five historical periods is calculated. The cache is language-specific, e.g., a volumeCount on an English-language item measures the number of other English-language items in that historical period.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the historical periods are 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days prior to the news item’s timestamp and are the same used in the novelty calculations. Thus, direct comparisons between similar and total items within the historical periods can be achieved.\n",

    "- ```itemCount```: Number of items\n",
    "- ```window```: Length of time the count covers nH (for hours) or nD (for days). Default values are “12H”, “24H”, “3D”, “5D”, and “7D”."
