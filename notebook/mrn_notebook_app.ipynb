    "## Machine Readable News Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Refinitiv Machine Readable News (MRN) is an advanced service for automating the consumption and systematic analysis of news. It delivers deep historical news archives, ultra-low latency structured news and news analytics directly to your applications. This enables algorithms to exploit the power of news to seize opportunities, capitalize on market inefficiencies and manage event risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "MRN aims for replacing the legacy News 2K (N2_UBMS and N2_STORY).\n",
    "\n",
    "### MRN Data behavior\n",
    "MRN is published over Elektron using an Open Message Model (OMM) envelope in News Text Analytics domain messages. The Real-time News content set is made available over MRN_STORY RIC. The content data is contained in a FRAGMENT field that has been compressed, and potentially fragmented across multiple messages, in order to reduce bandwidth and message size.\n",
    "\n",
    "A FRAGMENT field has a different data type based on a connection type:\n",
    "* RSSL connection (ESDK [C++](https://developers.refinitiv.com/elektron/elektron-sdk-cc)/[Java](https://developers.refinitiv.com/elektron/elektron-sdk-java)): BUFFER type\n",
    "* WebSocket connection: Base64 ascii string\n",
    "\n",
    "The data goes through the following series of transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The core content data is a UTF-8 JSON string\n",
    "2. This JSON string is compressed using gzip\n",
    "3. The compressed JSON is split into a number of fragments (BUFFER or Base64 ascii string) which each fit into a single update message\n",
    "4. The data fragments are added to an update message as the FRAGMENT field value in a FieldList envelope\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/mrn_process.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in order to parse the core content data, the application will need to reverse this process. The WebSocket application also need to convert a received Base64 string in a FRAGMENT field to bytes data before further process this field."

    "### MRN Data model\n",
    "\n",
    "Five fields, as well as the RIC itself, are necessary to determine whether the entire item has been received in its various fragments and how to concatenate the fragments to reconstruct the item:\n",
    "* MRN_SRC: identifier of the scoring/processing system that published the FRAGMENT\n",
    "* GUID: a globally unique identifier for the data item. All messages for this data item will have the same GUID values.\n",
    "* FRAGMENT: compressed data item fragment, itself\n",
    "* TOT_SIZE: total size in bytes of the fragmented data\n",
    "* FRAG_NUM: sequence number of fragments within a data item. This is set to 1 for the first fragment of each item published and is incremented for each subsequent fragment for the same item.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single MRN data item publication is uniquely identified by the combination of RIC, MRN_SRC, and GUID.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fragmentation\n",
    "For a given RIC-MRN_SRC-GUID combination, when a data item requires only a single message, then TOT_SIZE will equal the number of bytes in the FRAGMENT and FRAG_NUM will be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple messages are required, then the data item can be deemed as fully received once the sum of the number of bytes of each FRAGMENT equals TOT_SUM. The consumer will also observe that all FRAG_NUM range from 1 to the number of the fragment, with no intermediate integers skipped. In other words, a data item transmitted over three messages will contain FRAG_NUM values of 1, 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compression\n",
    "The FRAGMENT field is compressed with gzip compression, thus requiring the consumer to decompress to reveal the JSON plain-text data in that FID.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an MRN data item is sent in multiple messages, all the messages must be received and their FRAGMENTs concatenated before being decompressed. In other words, the FRAGMENTs should not be decompressed independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decompressed output is encoded in UTF-8 and formatted as JSON."

      "   삼성전자와 LG전자가 8K(4K·UHD의 4배 화질) TV의 화질 등 핵심 기술을 놓고 자사가 우월하다는 주장을 펼치며 정면 충돌했다. 밝기·화질선명도(CM)·컬러볼륨 등을 기준으로 자사 화질과 콘텐츠 재생 능력이 뛰어나다고 주장하고 있는데, '소비자에게 정보를 전달하는 기회가 될 수 있다'는 평가와 함께 '중국 업체들이 치고 올라오는 상황에서 한국 업체끼리 서로 이미지 타격을 줘 제 살 깎아 먹는 것' 아니냐는 비판도 나온다. 기술 논쟁 포문은 LG전자가 열었고, 삼성전자가 반격에 나섰다. LG전자는 지난 7일 독일 베를린에서 열린 정보기술(IT) 전시회 'IFA 2019'에서 삼성전자 8K QLED TV의 화질 문제를 지적한 데 이어 17일 오전 기자회견을 열고 또다시 공격을 가했다. 같은 날 오후 삼성전자도 기자간담회를 열고 이런 비판에 응수하며 LG전자 제품을 간접적으로 공격했다.\n",
      " \n",
      " LG전자가 삼성의 QLED(퀀텀닷발광다이오드) 8K TV에 대해 비판하는 포인트는 화질선명도다. CM이란 쉽게 말해 많아진 픽셀 개수만큼 밝기와 색깔이 제대로 표현되는지를 측정하는 지표다. 퍼센트로 표시되는데 숫자가 높을수록 제대로 픽셀이 구현돼 화질이 좋다는 게 LG전자 주장이다. 8K는 가로 픽셀 수가 약 8000개인 해상도를 뜻하고, 4K는 픽셀 수가 그 절반인 약 4000개다. LG전자 관계자는 \"LG의 유기발광다이오드(OLED) 8K TV의 CM이 90%인데, 삼성전자 제품은 12%에 그친다\"며 \"국제디스플레이계측위원회(ICDM) 기준에 따르면 CM이 50% 미만인 경우 화소 수가 8K에 해당하더라도 해상도는 8K라 말할 수 없다\"고 주장했다. 이 관계자는 \"삼성 제품 CM이 작년에 90%에서 올해 12%로 떨어졌는데, 시야각(TV를 옆에서 볼 때 화질·밝기 등이 어느 정도 왜곡되지 않는지를 평가하는 기준)을 개선하는 과정에서 나온 부작용으로 보인다\"고 설명했다. LG전자는 향후 열릴 ICDM 회의에서 8K 화질 평가 기준에 대한 논의가 있을 것으로 보고 있다. 또 LG전자는 삼성 TV를 부품별로 분해해 전시하며 QLED TV가 자발광 TV가 아니라 퀀텀닷(QD) 필름을 추가한 LCD TV라고 주장했다.\n",
      " \n",
      "  이에 대해 삼성전자 관계자는 \"8K 화질은 밝기, 컬러볼륨, 영상처리 기술, 광학·시스템 기술로 종합 판단해야 한다\"며 \"CM은 1927년 발표된 개념으로 물리적으로 화소 수를 세기 어려운 디스플레이나 흑백 TV 해상도 평가를 위해 사용됐으며 초고해상도 컬러 디스플레이 평가에는 적합하지 않다\"고 반박했다. 이 관계자는 \"ICDM조차 2016년 CM은 최신 디스플레이에 적용하기에는 불완전하며 새로운 평가 방법이 필요하다고 발표했다\"며 \"전문 매거진 등에서도 CM을 화질 평가 요소로 활용하고 있지 않고 QLED 8K는 국제 표준 기구 ISO가 규정한 해상도 기준(7680×4320)을 충족하며 인증을 획득했다\"고 덧붙였다. 삼성전자는 이날 시연을 열어 QLED 8K TV가 경쟁사 제품에 비해 콘텐츠 구현·최적화 측면에서 우위에 있다는 점을 강조했다. 이미지·동영상을 동시에 띄워 자사 제품에서는 작은 글씨도 선명하게 나오는 데 비해 경쟁사 TV 화면에서는 글씨가 뭉개지는 것을 보여줬다. QLED TV에서 8K로 재생된 영상이 경쟁사 제품에서는 재생되지 않는 현상도 보여줬다. 삼성전자는 최근 자사가 주도하고 있는 8K협회(글로벌 TV·패널·콘텐츠·칩업체 등 16개사 참여)를 통해 8K에 대해 해상도·밝기·영상 압축 등 핵심 기술의 글로벌 표준을 발표했다. 이에 대해 LG전자 관계자는 \"8K협회는 회원사들 기술 수준에 맞춰 자의적 표준을 발표했고 국제 표준에 부합되는 것인지 알 수 없다\"며 \"업계에서는 ICDM 기준을 많이 활용한다\"고 공격했다.\n",
      " \n",
      " 이에 대해 용석우 삼성전자 영상디스플레이사업부 상무는 \"현재 8K 시장이 성장하고 있는 단계에서 CM과 같은 소모적인 논쟁보다는 '8K협회'에 더 많은 기업이 참여해 미래 시장을 만들어 나가야 한다\"며 \"기준 정립을 위한 관련 업체 간 협의가 활성화되기를 희망한다\"고 강조했다. \n",
